Functionality/Use Case

Trackify is a Customer Management Portal that focuses primarily on server-side functionality. In the app users will be able to
View all the Customers registered to their database as well as a list of orders under their account. If needed users can perform 
Multiparameter search functions to filter data as needed (i.e Find by name, order status, etc.) it will also have advanced user authentification and permissions 
in which admins on the site such as customer support engineers or service representative will be able to create, delete and update basic contact information on user accounts,
while customers will only be able to login and view the logistics of their individual profiles. 


Technology/Code 

The server will be run with a Python/Django backend that links to a MySQL database demonstrating various relational database properties such as Cascading, One to One, One to Many, 
and Many to Many Relationships.
